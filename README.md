## Introduction

Wordle is a word puzzle game where the player has six attempts to guess a five-letter word. After each guess, the game provides feedback indicating which letters are correct and in the correct position, which letters are correct but in the wrong position, and which letters are not in the word at all.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive command-line interface
- Random word selection from a predefined list
- Feedback on each guess to help you solve the puzzle
- Written in C and C++ for performance and portability

## Installation

To compile and run the Wordle game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/nanda-gopal-sb/wordle.git
    cd wordle
    ```

2. Compile the code:
    ```sh
    g++ -o wordle wordle.cpp
    ```

3. Run the game:
    ```sh
    ./wordle
    ```

## Usage
